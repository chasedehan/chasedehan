### Hi, I'm Chase.

I'm currently at Tesorio, where I lead all Data Science, Machine Learning, and Analytics capabilities.  Our primary focus is to make unpredictable swings in future cash flows predictable with high performance machine learning.

Some things that get me stoked:
- Python (particularly list comprehensions)
- AutoML 
- Vim
